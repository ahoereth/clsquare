# CLSquare: Closed Loop Simulation System

CLS<sup>2</sup> (pronounced: clsquare) provides a standardized framework for testing (not only) Reinforcement Learning controllers on a (growing) number of different plants.

## Features

- Easy combination of different plants and controllers by definition in a configuration file.
- Lean interfaces for plants and controllers for a quick migration to and from CLS2 from and to other software environments.
- Optional graphical interface and visualization.
- Many demos for easy starting.

## Plants

- Simulations
     - Cart Pole (single, double and parallel), underactuated pole
     - Maze
     - Mountain Car
- Hardware Interfaces
     - Kinova Jaco
     - Robotis Bioloid

## Controllers

- Various static standard controllers (linear, PIDâ€¦)
- Table-based Q Reinforcement Learning
- Neural Q and policy controllers
- Gaussian Processes
- Kernel-based batch controller (Ormoneit and Sen, 2002)
- Fitted Q Iteration with Extra Trees (Ernst, Geurts and Wehenkel, 2005)

## Supported Platforms

The software is developed and tested under:

- Ubuntu Linux 12.04
- Mac OSX 10.8

Basic requirements:

- a C++ compiler (build-essential for Ubuntu, xcode for OSX)
- CMake 2.6.3 (2.8.2 is required for libgp)

Each module that has special requirements will report them during installation if they are missing.

## Installation

- Get a fresh copy of CLS2
- Unpack the source code

            tar xzf clsquare.tgz
- Compile the program

            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..
            make install

## Documentation

The most recent manual is included in the source package. 
In addition, documentation for the available modules can be generated using Doxygen by typing make doc in the program's build folder.
